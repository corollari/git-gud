> Btw, Joseph, you're a quality example of why I detest the github  interface. For some reason, github has attracted people who have zero  taste, don't care about commit logs, and can't be bothered.  The fact that I have higher standards then makes people like you make  snarky comments, thinking that you are cool.  You're a moron.  Linus
